			<p>Hello! My name is Tim LaRou and I'm currently learning web development with the University of Texas's Bootcamp program.</p>
			<p>Prior to web development, I was a senior associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the international tax qualitative solutions group. I primarily did data analysis using excel and SQL.  </p>
			<p>Other than that I was in the Marine Corps for 5 years.  I was first stationed in Korea for a year as a linguist. I was also deployed to Afghanistan for a year working in the intelligence field.  I was discharged in 2011 as a sergeant. I then attended the University of Minnesota graduating in 2014 with a degree in Accounting.  </p>
